# InfTrnSongs
Goes through a playlist I made of all of the OSTs from the show Infinity Train and installs them to a set path for recreational use.

Steps:
#1 download and install Python and make sure you choose custom installation and create environment variable
#2 use the pip install command in order to install bs4, pytube, PyQt5, and PyQtWebEngine
#3 create a new file named main.py and copy code from repository there.
#4 change the file directory in line 91 to change where files will downlaod MAKE SURE YOU USE DOUBLE \\ IN YOUR FILE PATH!
#5 run the python command "python3 main.py" and you're done :)
